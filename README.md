# Milkshake Website
The website demonstrates the journey from the initial business idea to the realization of a fully functional online presence.The project revolves around the creation of a bar named Milkshake, encompassing various elements such as business concept and requirements, logo design, color palette  selection, and even the use of AI for generation of product images to blend with the colour palette. This was by far one of the most fun projects I have worked on as I really got to play around with design and different front-end concepts. 

## Features 
- Unique designed logo intergrated into Nav and Footer elements.
- Images generated using AI to match theme.
- Use of icons for e-commerce and social media.
- UI/UX Design Principles applied in wireframes, mock-ups, and the final website.

## Technologies Used 
- HTML5 (Semantic)
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

## Design Process
- Business Conception: Conceptualize the business idea for Milkshake Bar.
- Brand Elements: Create a logo, pick a color scheme, and generate product elements using AI.
- Wireframes: Develop high to low fidelity wireframes based on design principles and user experience considerations.
- Mock-Ups: Create mock-ups of the website, focusing on mobile-friendly design first.
- Development: Build the website using semantic HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap for responsiveness.

## Challenges 
- Creating a mobile navbar that contained a logo that was off center of navbar itself. This initally caused delays in navbar expansion and was solved using toggle function.

## Future Improvements 
- Shop Accessible Features: Add more features to make the website more accessible for online shopping.
- Product Info Popout: Complete the product info popout for a more detailed product presentation.
