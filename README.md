# Milkshake website
This website demonstrates the process of a creating a business through to actualization in the form of a desktop and mobile friendly website. The project started with the conception of a business (a bar) called Milkshake. Once deciding on a business concept, a logo was created, a colour scheme was picked, product elements where even created using AI. Following closely were high to low fidelity wireframes relying on the principles of design, while keeping user experience in mind. 

With the mock-ups completed, the site was built mobile friendly first, and then a desktop site with a landing page that could lead the user to a product page. The site was built using semantic HTML5 and styled with CSS3 as well as using Bootstrap for the menu. The layout was achieved with a combination of Bootstrap and flexbox. Finally, a touch of JavaScript was added to toggle the position of the logo in the mobile version. 

Not going to lie I got a thrill out of creating a service and designing from the ground up. I trend towards front-end development so the whole UI web designing component was grand, and then of course implementing the code itself was a ball. If I was to challenge myself further with this product it would be to add more shop accessible features and complete the product info popout.
